# TypeScript Error Fixes

This document outlines the TypeScript errors that were fixed in the EduEasy codebase and the
approach taken to resolve them.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Unused React Imports**

   - Problem: Many files had `import React from 'react'` that's not needed in React 18
   - Solution: Removed unnecessary imports while preserving those that use React namespace

2. **Missing Return Types**

   - Problem: Several functions didn't have explicit return types
   - Solution: Added proper return types (e.g., `JSX.Element`, `void`, etc.)

3. **Footer Component Issue**

   - Problem: The footer.tsx file contained an AdminButton component instead
   - Solution: Created a proper Footer component and moved the AdminButton to its own file

4. **Type Safety Improvements**
   - Problem: Some functions had callbacks without proper return values
   - Solution: Added explicit return statements to ensure type safety

## Scripts Created

### 1. `fix-react-imports.js`

Automatically removes unused React imports from TSX files while preserving imports where React
namespace is actually used.

Usage:

```
node scripts/fix-react-imports.js
```

### 2. `find-missing-return-types.js`

Identifies functions that might be missing return type annotations.

Usage:

```
node scripts/find-missing-return-types.js
```

### 3. `fix-typescript-errors.js`

Master script that runs all the fixes in sequence.

Usage:

```
node scripts/fix-typescript-errors.js
```

### 4. `run-typescript-fixes.js`

Comprehensive script that runs the fixes, performs a TypeScript type check, and runs ESLint.

Usage:

```
node scripts/run-typescript-fixes.js
```

### 5. `check-typescript-config.js`

Script to check the TypeScript configuration and suggest improvements.

Usage:

```
node scripts/check-typescript-config.js
```

## Manual Fixes Applied

1. Fixed the footer component:

   - Created a proper Footer component with named export
   - Moved AdminButton to its own file

2. Added return types to key components:

   - Added `JSX.Element` return type to Skeleton component
   - Added `JSX.Element` return type to Toaster component
   - Added `SidebarContext` return type to useSidebar function
   - Added `JSX.Element` return type to Stepper component
   - Added `JSX.Element` return type to lazyLoad and lazyLoadAdmin functions

3. Fixed callback functions:
   - Added proper return statements to callbacks in SponsorshipsPage

## Next Steps

1. Run the `run-typescript-fixes.js` script to automatically fix issues and check for errors
2. Manually review and fix any remaining TypeScript errors
3. Run a full build to verify all errors have been resolved
4. Test the application to ensure functionality is preserved

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. Always include return types for functions
2. Don't include React import unless you're using the React namespace
3. Use named exports for components when appropriate
4. Ensure all code paths in functions have proper return statements
