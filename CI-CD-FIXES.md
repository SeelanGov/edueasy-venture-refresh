# CI/CD Fixes and Local Development Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed critical build error in Supabase client**
   - The file `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` had a syntax error with an export statement inside a conditional block
   - Restructured the code to properly handle preview environments without syntax errors

2. **Fixed TypeScript error in SubjectEntry component**
   - Updated the type definition in `src/components/profile-completion/SubjectEntry.tsx` to use proper TypeScript syntax

## Remaining Issues

1. **Linting Errors**
   - There are still numerous linting errors, primarily related to:
     - Usage of `any` types (should be replaced with proper types)
     - React Hook dependency warnings
     - Empty interface definitions

2. **Large Bundle Size**
   - The build process warns about large chunk sizes
   - Consider code splitting and optimizing the bundle size

## How to Test CI/CD Locally

We've created two scripts to help with testing and deployment:

1. **Test CI/CD Workflow Locally**
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test-ci-cd.ps1
   ```
   This script:
   - Loads environment variables from .env file
   - Runs environment checks
   - Performs type checking
   - Runs linting
   - Builds the project

2. **Push Changes to GitHub**
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File push-changes.ps1 "Your commit message"
   ```
   This script:
   - Adds all changes
   - Commits with your message
   - Pushes to the main branch

## Environment Variables

The CI/CD workflow requires these environment variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

These are set in the local `.env` file and need to be configured as secrets in GitHub Actions.

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining linting errors
2. Optimize bundle size
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Update GitHub repository secrets with the required environment variables
