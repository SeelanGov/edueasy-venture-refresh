# Supabase RLS & Performance Improvements (2025-05-15)

## Summary
This migration addresses performance advisor warnings and security best practices for the Supabase project. It includes:
- Consolidation of redundant RLS policies
- Restriction of public access to sensitive tables
- Optimization of RLS policies to avoid subqueries
- Creation of missing indexes for performance
- Restriction of error log access to admins only

## Migration Steps
1. Apply the SQL migration in `supabase/migrations/2025-05-15_rls_performance_improvements.sql` using the Supabase CLI or dashboard.
2. Review all policies in the Supabase dashboard to ensure no public access remains on sensitive tables.
3. Test RLS policies:
   - As a public (unauthenticated) user
   - As an authenticated user (owner and non-owner)
   - As an admin
4. Monitor performance and security logs for any issues.

## Testing Strategy
- Use Supabase's policy tester or integration tests to simulate user actions (view, insert, update, delete) for each table.
- Validate that access is correctly granted or denied based on the user's role and ownership.

## Example Test Cases
- Authenticated user can only access their own documents, applications, and education records.
- Public users cannot access any sensitive data.
- Only admins can access error logs.
