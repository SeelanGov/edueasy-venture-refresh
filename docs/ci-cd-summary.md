# CI/CD Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the CI/CD implementation for the EduEasy project. The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of three main stages: Build and Test, Staging Deployment, and Production Deployment.

## Key Components

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)
   - Defines the complete CI/CD pipeline
   - Handles build, test, and deployment stages
   - Includes error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **Support Scripts**
   - `fix-rollup-deps.js`: Handles platform-specific Rollup dependencies
   - `check-env-vars.js`: Validates required environment variables
   - `deploy-staging.ps1` and `deploy-production.ps1`: Handle deployment to staging and production
   - `check-ci-status.ps1`: Checks the status of GitHub Actions workflows
   - `verify-ci-cd-setup.js`: Verifies the CI/CD setup

3. **Vite Configurations**
   - `vite.config.ts`: Standard Vite configuration
   - `vite.config.ci.ts`: CI-specific Vite configuration with optimizations for CI environments

## Implementation Details

### Build and Test Stage

The build and test stage:
- Checks out the code
- Sets up Node.js
- Installs dependencies
- Fixes Rollup dependencies
- Runs type checking, linting, and tests
- Builds the application
- Uploads build artifacts

### Deployment Stages

The deployment stages:
- Download build artifacts
- Set up SSH for deployment
- Deploy to staging/production servers using rsync
- Include proper error handling and notifications

### Environment Variables

The CI/CD pipeline uses several environment variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for Supabase integration
- `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` for SSH authentication
- Server-specific variables for deployment

## Verification

The CI/CD setup can be verified using:
```
npm run ci:verify-setup
```

This script checks:
- Required files are present
- Required npm scripts are defined
- GitHub workflow contains all necessary jobs

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created:
- CI/CD section in README.md
- Detailed setup guide in docs/ci-cd-setup.md
- This summary document

## Next Steps

1. **Set up GitHub Secrets**: Add all required secrets to the GitHub repository
2. **Configure Deployment Servers**: Ensure staging and production servers are properly configured
3. **Test the Pipeline**: Push changes to the main branch to test the complete pipeline
4. **Monitor Deployments**: Use the ci:status script to monitor deployments

## Conclusion

The CI/CD implementation provides a robust, automated pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the EduEasy application. It includes proper error handling, fallback mechanisms, and comprehensive documentation to ensure smooth operation and easy maintenance.
